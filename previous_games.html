        <p>The game series that changed the industry - even if the industry doesn't know it - the Flute Quest series became a national institution (in Bulgaria) thanks to its revolutionary Player Frustration Interface and intricate branching path focus. Though, at the time, the series was too boundary breaking and marred by controversy for many to handle, today Flute Quest is seen as a legendary step in gaming history, ranking in the top 500 of IGN's Most Influential Gaming Series poll.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lets take a look back at the series that changed it all.

            <h3>
                In 1987, YOU saved the world with a flute.
            </h3>
        <div>

           <p>Beyond that, little is known for sure. In 1990, Flute Quest was unfairly linked to a series of murders in Sibiu, Romania by Bulgarian nationalist Asen Sobolev who just happened to be a huge fan of the game. Despite no inherent links between the events and Flute Quest, media sensationalism and public outcry caused the game to be banned in dozens of nations worldwide. Due to this unfortunate turn of events, all known copies of Flute Quest were destroyed with only one copy remaining, which is now hosted in the Bulgarian Institute of gaming with strict instructions that it must never be played.

            After the deaths of all three members of Team Sleep Deprived, the creators of the original two games, in 1997, the exact plot of the game is unknown, with only scattered memories remaining from those who played the game.

                <h3>
                    In 1991, YOU saved the world with a flute. Again.

                Presumably following on from the events of the previous game which, as stated above, are lost to time, our brave adventurer finds himself attacked by Keith the dragon and must go on a quest to retrieve the pieces of his magical flute and save the world. Along the way, he meets memorable characters such as Steve, Shrok and The Merchant, who frustrate him on his quest.

                Winner of four Bulgaries at the Български награди за игри (Bulgarian Gaming Awards), Flute Quest 2 became the fastest selling game in Bulgarian history. Though many say this is due to the controversy surrounding the series, we know better. A compelling narative and the return of our compelling and improved Player Frustration Interface made the game a must play for all gaming enthusiasts who could track down a copy.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the licenses now expired, Flute Quest 2 is free to play and share - though as far as we are aware, only the Bulgarian regional release survives to this day.
